# Unity.VectorGraphics (programmatic) example

This is a quick, bare-bones example of how to set up a Unity.VectorGraphics scene with a circle in it, and how to render that to a sprite.

NOTE: You MAY have to go to Window > Package Manager and enable the Vector Graphics preview package. Since it is a preview package, you must have preview packages enabled. (Advanced > Show Preview Packages)

Tested in Unity 2019.2.14f1
